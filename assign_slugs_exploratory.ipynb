    "article1 = \"Get local news delivered to your inbox!The public waterfront in the village of Ephraim suffered extensive damage from high water and storm surges.Lake Michigan’s waters reached record highs in July 2020, inundating buildings on Washington Island, which sits off of Wisconsin’s Door Peninsula. Here, water is inches away from completely submerging piers at Jackson Harbor on July 24.Hoyt Purinton, president of the Washington Island Ferry line and a seasoned captain, leads a fleet of five ferries that navigate the waters off of Wisconsin’s Door County peninsula year-round. His family business has faced a host of challenges from Lake Michigan’s shifting waters in recent years. “It reminds you you’re not in charge,” Purinton says.The village of Ephraim recently completed a $358,000 project to place large rocks along the shoreline and create a new sidewalk and park space downtown. The rock barriers aim to protect the Lake Michigan shoreline against erosion from powerful waves, which have whittled away land in recent years.Mike Kahr, an engineer and owner of Death’s Door Marine, has watched Lake Michigan’s water levels fluctuate during his 40-plus year career. But even he hasn’t seen water levels swing quite this rapidly.Eight years ago, Kahr and his crew dredged sand from the lake bottom so passenger and cargo boats could reach port. But as water levels surged to a record high last year, Kahr fielded call after call from property owners rushing to protect their shorelines by installing barriers to keep the waves from eroding their beaches — more requests than his crew could handle.Kahr isn’t necessarily celebrating the boom in business.“Yes, I make money at it. But I don’t like to take people’s money when the waves are lapping at their shoreline, and they’re taking money out of the retirement account,” he said.Unlike the oceans, whose waters are rising as Earth’s steady warming melts glaciers, Great Lakes water levels largely depend on weather and are harder to predict. Lake Michigan’s levels have tended to fluctuate in cycles throughout its recorded history, swinging up or down roughly every three to 10 years.Contractors, ferry boat captains, climate scientists and home owners call those ebbs and flows part of life along the lake. But they are now living through the most dramatic shifts in their lifetimes.Between record low waters in January 2013 and a record high in July 2020, Lakes Michigan and Huron collectively swung more than 6 feet, according to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers data. The lakes have since dipped about a foot and a half, but remain above average. Climate scientists attribute the volatility to the interplay of the region’s rising temperatures and precipitation from more frequent and intense storms.Low-water years require crews like Kahr’s to dredge waterways. But high water brings storm surges that swallow beaches, swamp docks, erode lakeside bluffs and shutter businesses.The Great Lakes region will spend nearly $2 billion over the next five years combatting coastal damage exacerbated by climate change, according to a recent survey of 241 local governments by the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, a coalition of 128 U.S. and Canadian mayors. Wisconsin will bear an estimated burden of at least $245 million, said Sheboygan Mayor Ryan Sorenson, a coalition board member.“Whether you think it’s cyclical, whether you think it’s climate change, folks in Sheboygan and Wisconsin understand that something needs to be done, regardless of your political affiliation,” Sorenson said.On a windy late September morning, the Washington Island Ferry rocked like an ocean liner in a squall. As the boat headed north through Death’s Door, an often turbulent passage between the mainland and Washington Island, waves crashed into its bow, spritzing passengers. In the distance to the east, past the abandoned lighthouse resembling the skeleton of a forgotten church, Lake Michigan’s waters stretched endlessly into the horizon.The Great Lakes hold about 20% of the Earth’s surface freshwater. And Lake Michigan, the third-biggest Great Lake by surface area, stretches 118 miles across at its widest point. Holding 1.3 quadrillion gallons of water, its waves can sink ships and pulverize shoreline structures.Hoyt Purinton, president of the Washington Island Ferry line, leads a fleet of five ships that navigate the waters off Wisconsin’s Door County peninsula year-round — each big enough to carry about 150 passengers and 20 vehicles between the county’s mainland and its inhabited island to the north.A thumb jutting into Lake Michigan, Door County boasts 300 miles of shoreline. Tourists flock to its beaches in the summer; come autumn, its sugar maples explode with orange and yellow. In 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic’s challenges, tourism generated nearly $400 million for the local economy.Purinton, whose family has lived in the area since before Wisconsin’s statehood, has faced a host of water challenges in recent years. Low waters in 2013 forced the ferry to move operations to deeper waters, costing up to $750,000.High water in 2020 swamped parts of the Washington Island Ferry’s landing and the island, leaving captains to contend with floating debris. Water also flooded the dock at popular camping spot Rock Island, just east of Washington Island. A submerged dock and pandemic-related health concerns forced the closure of Rock Island State Park much of last year, cutting into state park system revenues.“It’s been a wild ride. It opens up your world view. It reminds you you’re not in charge,” Purinton said. “The water always wins.”As of 2013, Lake Michigan had experienced nearly 15 years of low water.Many assumed the trend would continue, and nobody predicted the lake’s dramatic rise in the succeeding years, said Drew Gronewold, a University of Michigan professor and expert on weather’s impact on the Great Lakes.“In 2013, everyone was concerned about rising temperatures, loss of ice cover, and there was a narrative at that time that water levels are just going to continue to decline forever in light of climate change,” Gronewold said.But early 2014 delivered a global-scale phenomenon: a polar vortex. “The cold Arctic air surrounding the top hemisphere — it wobbled, and it wobbled dramatically,” Gronewold said.That “wobbling” destabilized a band of Arctic air, sending south a blast of frigid air that parked over the Great Lakes region for weeks. Wind chills in Chicago dropped to minus 42 degrees.The freeze thickened ice cover on the lakes, limiting evaporation. That set the stage for high water in the following years — along with intense rain and snow likely linked to Earth’s warming, Gronewold said.More than a century of data from the Corps of Engineers show the cyclical fluctuation of waters in Lakes Michigan and Huron — measured together because of their connection at the Straits of Mackinac.Weather primarily drives the ebbs and flows, four scientists who track water levels told Wisconsin Watch. Precipitation boosts water levels, while evaporation — which increases with warmer temperatures — lowers them.The Great Lakes region is warming faster than elsewhere in the contiguous United States over the past century, according to a 2019 report by the Environmental Law and Policy Center. That’s tending to cause ice cover to form later in the year, lengthening the season for evaporation. Meanwhile, the region saw much more rain and snow, with more precipitation coming from “unusually large events,” like severe storms.These two factors create an increasingly powerful “tug of war” effect that will likely bring more extreme lake level shifts, Gronewold said.“These two forces are opposite each other, and they are gaining strength as the climate changes,” Gronewold said.Intense evaporation from 1998 to 2013 dramatically lowered the lakes. Waters then rose during the region’s subsequent “wettest five- to 10-year period in recorded history.”These dramatic shifts in water levels on Lakes Michigan and Huron will likely become increasingly common, said Michael Notaro, associate director of UW-Madison’s Center for Climatic Research.Beyond speeding up coastal erosion, more frequent, intense storms bring heavier rains that increase the runoff of fertilizer into lakes, feeding algal blooms on nutrient-rich lakes that harm fish and other wildlife.“It’s already happening,” said Notaro.Sorenson, who at 27 serves as Sheboygan’s youngest-ever mayor, grew up in the lakeside city of 48,000. Sometimes called the Malibu of the Midwest, Sheboygan is home to fleets of charter fishing boats, sandy beaches and surfers who brave winter waters.Sorenson remembers summer days he spent at the beach as a child, swimming, catching fish and building sand castles. And he remembers when rising waters began to wash those beaches away. Wanting to help property owners respond to lakeshore erosion is part of what inspired him to run for mayor, he said in a 2020 campaign video.“In the last few years, we’ve seen tremendously high water impact the business community on the boardwalk, where we’ve had to throw sandbags out there just to try to keep it at bay. And that’s not a long-term solution for our community,” he said.“We’re seeing cliffs just getting washed away, falling into the lake.”Great Lakes communities have spent $878 million in the past two years responding to coastal damage, according to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative. Wisconsin’s expected $245 million in costs over the next five years is conservative, Sorenson said, because the group’s survey doesn’t include every jurisdiction.Shoreline erosion — and paying for infrastructure improvements needed to protect against damage from high water — challenges urban centers and small towns along the Great Lakes.In Door County, about an hour and half north of Sheboygan, marina owners and village crews scrambled to rescue property, limit damage to piers and stack sandbags to protect the town’s buildings after November gales battered the village of Ephraim in 2019. After stones and debris washed onto the road at the south end of the village, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation added several hundred feet of rock alongside the highway to protect it from a future storm surge.Additionally, the village launched a $358,000 project to rebuild a limestone wall and add more shoreline protection near Ephraim’s historic downtown.The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has begun an analysis of the Door Peninsula to inform residents on how to grapple with an unpredictable Lake Michigan.Prompting DNR’s analysis: a soaring tally of permitting requests from residents to build barriers during high water years and dredge during low-water years, said James Pardee, DNR environmental analysis and review specialist.For Sheboygan, preparing for the future means reinforcing breakwater areas and adding an additional seawall or protective rock layers called riprap, said Sorenson. It also means planting native vegetation, which stabilizes bluff slopes to help limit erosion.But budgeting for such investments isn’t easy for a mid-size city like Sheboygan. That’s why the mayor hopes to secure federal and state aid.“I can’t do this alone,” Sorenson said. “Whether it’s Sheboygan, Racine, Sturgeon Bay, Green Bay, Marinette, Milwaukee, and everywhere in between, we need to have a clear focus in terms of how we address this.”Get local news delivered to your inbox!The girl's mother reportedly told police she would allow the child to stay with Darese T.

Dee J. Hall / Wisconsin Watch\\nArticle Post TypesReading Time:  7 minutespost\\nX\\n\\nTo understand how Wisconsin’s labor shortage has transformed the jobs market, look no further than an Oct. 14 job fair to hire workers for expansions of Pierce Manufacturing’s production plants in Neenah and Fox Crossing.\\nThe fire truck manufacturer aimed to hire 200 assemblers, welders, electricians and painters.\\nPierce touted competitive pay, health and well-being services and matching retirement contributions as most major employers do now, and it highlighted another incentive: $10,000 in educational reimbursement per year for employees working toward a college degree.\\nThe company conducted interviews and drug tests on the spot, and it welcomed candidates with little experience. Becky Bartoszek, president and CEO of the Fox Cities Chamber of Commerce, said the company hired 100 people at the fair — an example of how aggressive employers must be to find talent.\\xa0\\nThe fierce competition for talent won’t end soon, and employers across industries must adapt to survive the statewide worker shortage, northeastern Wisconsin workforce experts said. Until then, residents must continue to live with the impacts of a tight labor market: Store and restaurant closures, supply shortages and longer wait times.\\nThousands of jobs are going unfilled due to longstanding demographic trends and workers’ changing expectations about benefits, pay, hours and workplace culture.\\xa0\\nThat means employers must rethink recruitment. It won’t be easy, but the stakes could not be higher, said Eric Vanden Heuvel, vice president of talent and education with the Greater Green Bay Chamber, during a recent workforce panel discussion at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay convened by the USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin.\\xa0\\n“Evolve or die,” he said. “If your business takes the approach ‘This is how we do things,’ you won’t survive.”\\nHere are the key questions and answers for employees, employers and communities as they navigate a tight labor market in Wisconsin, according to experts who participated in the discussion.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nDouble your impact\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOne-time\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDonation amount\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t$\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMonthly\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDonation amount\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t$\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnnually\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDonation amount\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t$\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour contribution is appreciated.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDonate Now\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs this a temporary thing?\\nNo, it’s the acceleration of a trend that precedes the pandemic.\\xa0\\nBirth rates have steadily declined since the births of 76 million Baby Boomers between 1946 and 1964, leaving fewer workers to replace retirees. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated retirements. Vanden Heuvel expects such challenges to continue for at least a decade.\\xa0\\n“It just results in more jobs than there are people,” he said.\\xa0\\nWhat does that mean for business?\\nCompanies must keep their benefits and salary packages competitive, seek out employee input, and collaborate regionally to meet workforce needs, especially in business sectors such as paper and other manufacturing, transportation, health care and hospitality.\\xa0\\nVanden Heuvel said competing businesses must cooperate in areas like recruiting talent to the region. He cited school districts as an example.\\xa0\\nAngela Ball, left, of Oshkosh, Wis., gathers job opportunity information from the vehicle manufacturer Meritor with her sons Jace and Austin, right, during the Oshkosh Area Employment Fair on Oct.12, 2021 at the Oshkosh Arena in Oshkosh.

Similarly, younger workers often cite work-life balance as an important factor when picking a job.\\xa0\\xa0\\nChambers, regional economic development agencies and some employers also have seen success traveling to talent, rather than waiting for it to come to them.\\nBartoszek cited a recent recruiting trip to Michigan Technological University. Rather than the standard spongy footballs or pens to hand out, the Fox Cities Chamber and employers parked a Pierce fire engine and other equipment on the campus, grilled burgers and gave away T-shirts to anyone who talked to an employer about jobs.\\nGraduating students have repeatedly told chamber officials and recruiters on such trips that the specific job didn’t matter as much as a community’s amenities and quality of life. This trip was no different.\\xa0\\nThe event drew 600 students, eclipsing the university’s goal of 150.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat does that mean for employees?\\nEmployees have more options and greater bargaining power when it comes to finding a job. This is the first time in decades that employees “have the upper hand,” said Allen Huffcutt, an associate professor of management at UW-Green Bay’s Cofrin School of Business.\\xa0\\n“They feel empowered, like they’re not helpless,” he said. “They can be proactive and change things.”\\nJeff Behm works at a forging press at Walker Forge in Clintonville, Wis.  Wm. Glasheen / USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\\nIn September, a record-breaking 4.4 million people quit their jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the United States is seeing an uptick in workers going on strike.\\xa0\\n“Employees are in a position where you don’t have to stay in a job you’re not happy in,” Bartoszek said.\\xa0\\nShe recommends people looking for a new position seek out companies that offer the benefits that are most important to them, such as tuition reimbursement, remote work opportunities or paid time off, for example.\\xa0\\n“Tear down your preconceived barriers about what you can and cannot do, especially around job requirements,” Vanden Heuvel said. “The concept that this job wants five years experience and you need to have this degree and this background, those are oftentimes self-limiting beliefs.”\\nAre sign-on bonuses/incentives making a difference?\\nNo.\\nExperts say they only encourage employee churn at a time of low unemployment and workforce engagement at levels near its pre-pandemic high.\\nWisconsin’s September labor force participation rate was 66.6%, higher than the national rate of 61.6% and up from 66.5% in August. The workforce participation rate measures how many people ages 16 or older are working or actively seeking work.\\xa0\\nA Kwik Trip sign encourages job-seekers to apply at the convenience store company.  Gary C. Klein / USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\\nWisconsin’s unemployment rate in September was 3.9%, while the national unemployment rate was 4.8%, according to the Department of Workforce Development.\\xa0\\nThe Fox Cities Chamber of Commerce does not advise businesses to offer sign-on bonuses in that environment because it “led to a new generation of job jumping,” Bartoszek said. Some workers will try out a job for six months and then jump to the next one for the bonus, she said.\\xa0\\nInstead, experts suggested focusing on incentives like tuition assistance for immediate family members, flexible schedules, opportunities to advance and assistance with basic needs like child care.\\nWhat would bring more people into the workforce?\\nEmployers and communities must address issues like access to child care, affordable housing and transportation to bolster the pool of workers.\\xa0\\nAriens Co.’s partnership with KinderCare to open a child care facility in August for workers in Brillion is a great example of how larger manufacturers are answering workers’ needs, Franz said. However, not every business can undertake such an expense.\\nBartoszek said employers have partnered with chambers of commerce or other businesses interested in expanding access to child care.\\nBrillion Early Learning Center, a childcare partnership between Ariens Co. and KinderCare, opened in Brillion, Wis., this summer. The center serves Ariens workers and the broader community.  Samantha Madar / USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\\nAdditionally, employers must connect with historically underemployed populations that can fill the demand for jobs: people with disabilities, people with criminal records, retirees, people for whom English is a second language and people of color.\\xa0\\nChristina Thor, 9to5 Women Wisconsin’s state director, said a lack of access to affordable child care is among the biggest barriers to work faced by women with children, particularly women of color, according to a survey by members of the grassroots advocacy group for working women.\\n“If you want women here, take a look at family structure first. Take a look at their priorities first and they will come to you,” Thor said.\\xa0\\nThor, who became state director in October, said parents working second or third shift jobs have little or no access to child care services. She said there also is a major need in northeastern Wisconsin for child care services that are sensitive to the needs of the region’s diverse communities of color.\\xa0\\n“Make sure (child care) is culturally competent and linguistically competent,” Thor said. “If I want my child to speak my native tongue and to know my culture and know what happens at home, that’s a better, trusting relationship and it improves overall child development.”\\nFranz noted there are 482,000 people in Wisconsin with disabilities, “a huge labor market we’re missing out on” and another 9,000 people exit the correctional system each year.\\xa0\\nCraig Coleman, a Green Bay-based job developer and transition coach with Forward Service Corp., said most people leaving the corrections system want to work. The Madison-based nonprofit provides training and support service to people exiting the corrections system in 46 of the state’s 72 counties, but Coleman said communities should better support people as they return to the workforce.\\xa0\\nHe said his grant-funded job is to help returning workers get help with resumes, car repairs, training courses, child care assistance or anything else that may stand in the way of landing a well-paying job.\\n“If we can provide them with a family supporting wage, that’s one thing off their back that can increase their chance of being successful,” Coleman said. “Ninety-nine percent of the justice involved population are good employees. They’ve figured out what went wrong with their lives and they do not want to go back. That alone makes them good employees.”\\nThe Bay Area Workforce Development Board, a training and job search agency that serves an 11-county region, is launching a new initiative to actively connect with historically underemployed populations, said executive director Matt Valiquette.\\nValiquette recalled his own frustration looking for work after retiring from the Marine Corps a decade ago. He sent out resumes with no response. After a visit to a job center, Valiquette tweaked his resume, and soon his phone was ringing with offers.\\n“It was a bad feeling being 40, feeling like a failure and not knowing where to turn. How many others give up in those circumstances?” he said. “We can’t afford for them to give up.”\\nContact Natalie Brophy at 715-216-5452 or nbrophy@gannett.com; follow her on Twitter at @brophy_natalie.

The Madison-based nonprofit provides training and support service to people exiting the corrections system in 46 of the state\\'s 72 counties, but Coleman said communities should better support people as they return to the workforce.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>He said his grant-funded job is to help returning workers get help with resumes, car repairs, training courses, child care assistance or anything else that may stand in the way of landing a well-paying job.</p>\\n<p>“If we can provide them with a family supporting wage, that’s one thing off their back that can increase their chance of being successful,” Coleman said. “Ninety-nine percent of the justice involved population are good employees. They’ve figured out what went wrong with their lives and they do not want to go back. That alone makes them good employees.”</p>\\n<p>The Bay Area Workforce Development Board, a training and job search agency that serves an 11-county region, is launching a new initiative to actively connect with historically underemployed populations, said executive director Matt Valiquette.</p>\\n<p>Valiquette recalled his own frustration looking for work after retiring from the Marine Corps a decade ago. He sent out resumes with no response. After a visit to a job center, Valiquette tweaked his resume, and soon his phone was ringing with offers.</p>\\n<p>“It was a bad feeling being 40, feeling like a failure and not knowing where to turn. How many others give up in those circumstances?” he said. “We can’t afford for them to give up.”</p>\\n<p><em>Contact Natalie Brophy at 715-216-5452 or nbrophy@gannett.com; follow her on Twitter at </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brophy_natalie\"><em>@brophy_natalie</em></a><em>.

       " madison.com‘The water always wins’: Calls to protect shorelines as volatile Lake Michigan inflicts heavy tollMARIO KORAN Wisconsin Watch, WPR31-39 minutesMARIO KORAN Wisconsin Watch, WPRMike Kahr, an engineer and owner of Death’s Door Marine, has watched Lake Michigan’s water levels fluctuate during his 40-plus year career. But even he hasn’t seen water levels swing quite this rapidly.Eight years ago, Kahr and his crew dredged sand from the lake bottom so passenger and cargo boats could reach port. But as water levels surged to a record high last year, Kahr fielded call after call from property owners rushing to protect their shorelines by installing barriers to keep the waves from eroding their beaches — more requests than his crew could handle.Fierce waves from Lake Michigan slam the shore00:00 00:00spaceplay / pausequnload | stopffullscreenshift + ←→slower / faster←→seek . seek to previous12… 6 seek to 10%, 20% … 60%XColor Settings    Aa    Aa    Aa    AaTextBackgroundOpacity SettingsTextBackgroundResetKahr isn’t necessarily celebrating the boom in business.“Yes, I make money at it. But I don’t like to take people’s money when the waves are lapping at their shoreline, and they’re taking money out of the retirement account,” he said.Unlike the oceans, whose waters are rising as Earth’s steady warming melts glaciers, Great Lakes water levels largely depend on weather and are harder to predict. Lake Michigan’s levels have tended to fluctuate in cycles throughout its recorded history, swinging up or down roughly every three to 10 years.People are also reading…Contractors, ferry boat captains, climate scientists and home owners call those ebbs and flows part of life along the lake. But they are now living through the most dramatic shifts in their lifetimes.Between record low waters in January 2013 and a record high in July 2020, Lakes Michigan and Huron collectively swung more than 6 feet, according to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers data. The lakes have since dipped about a foot and a half, but remain above average. Climate scientists attribute the volatility to the interplay of the region’s rising temperatures and precipitation from more frequent and intense storms.Low-water years require crews like Kahr’s to dredge waterways. But high water brings storm surges that swallow beaches, swamp docks, erode lakeside bluffs and shutter businesses.The Great Lakes region will spend nearly $2 billion over the next five years combatting coastal damage exacerbated by climate change, according to a recent survey of 241 local governments by the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, a coalition of 128 U.S. and Canadian mayors. Wisconsin will bear an estimated burden of at least $245 million, said Sheboygan Mayor Ryan Sorenson, a coalition board member.“Whether you think it’s cyclical, whether you think it’s climate change, folks in Sheboygan and Wisconsin understand that something needs to be done, regardless of your political affiliation,” Sorenson said.Powerful watersOn a windy late September morning, the Washington Island Ferry rocked like an ocean liner in a squall. As the boat headed north through Death’s Door, an often turbulent passage between the mainland and Washington Island, waves crashed into its bow, spritzing passengers. In the distance to the east, past the abandoned lighthouse resembling the skeleton of a forgotten church, Lake Michigan’s waters stretched endlessly into the horizon.The Great Lakes hold about 20% of the Earth’s surface freshwater. And Lake Michigan, the third-biggest Great Lake by surface area, stretches 118 miles across at its widest point. Holding 1.3 quadrillion gallons of water, its waves can sink ships and pulverize shoreline structures.Hoyt Purinton, president of the Washington Island Ferry line, leads a fleet of five ships that navigate the waters off Wisconsin’s Door County peninsula year-round — each big enough to carry about 150 passengers and 20 vehicles between the county’s mainland and its inhabited island to the north.A thumb jutting into Lake Michigan, Door County boasts 300 miles of shoreline. Tourists flock to its beaches in the summer; come autumn, its sugar maples explode with orange and yellow. In 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic’s challenges, tourism generated nearly $400 million for the local economy.Purinton, whose family has lived in the area since before Wisconsin’s statehood, has faced a host of water challenges in recent years. Low waters in 2013 forced the ferry to move operations to deeper waters, costing up to $750,000.High water in 2020 swamped parts of the Washington Island Ferry’s landing and the island, leaving captains to contend with floating debris. Water also flooded the dock at popular camping spot Rock Island, just east of Washington Island. A submerged dock and pandemic-related health concerns forced the closure of Rock Island State Park much of last year, cutting into state park system revenues.“It’s been a wild ride. It opens up your world view. It reminds you you’re not in charge,” Purinton said. “The water always wins.”Climate ‘tug of war’As of 2013, Lake Michigan had experienced nearly 15 years of low water.Many assumed the trend would continue, and nobody predicted the lake’s dramatic rise in the succeeding years, said Drew Gronewold, a University of Michigan professor and expert on weather’s impact on the Great Lakes.“In 2013, everyone was concerned about rising temperatures, loss of ice cover, and there was a narrative at that time that water levels are just going to continue to decline forever in light of climate change,” Gronewold said.But early 2014 delivered a global-scale phenomenon: a polar vortex. “The cold Arctic air surrounding the top hemisphere — it wobbled, and it wobbled dramatically,” Gronewold said.That “wobbling” destabilized a band of Arctic air, sending south a blast of frigid air that parked over the Great Lakes region for weeks. Wind chills in Chicago dropped to minus 42 degrees.The freeze thickened ice cover on the lakes, limiting evaporation. That set the stage for high water in the following years — along with intense rain and snow likely linked to Earth’s warming, Gronewold said.More than a century of data from the Corps of Engineers show the cyclical fluctuation of waters in Lakes Michigan and Huron — measured together because of their connection at the Straits of Mackinac.Weather primarily drives the ebbs and flows, four scientists who track water levels told Wisconsin Watch. Precipitation boosts water levels, while evaporation — which increases with warmer temperatures — lowers them.The Great Lakes region is warming faster than elsewhere in the contiguous United States over the past century, according to a 2019 report by the Environmental Law and Policy Center. That’s tending to cause ice cover to form later in the year, lengthening the season for evaporation. Meanwhile, the region saw much more rain and snow, with more precipitation coming from “unusually large events,” like severe storms.These two factors create an increasingly powerful “tug of war” effect that will likely bring more extreme lake level shifts, Gronewold said.“These two forces are opposite each other, and they are gaining strength as the climate changes,” Gronewold said.Intense evaporation from 1998 to 2013 dramatically lowered the lakes. Waters then rose during the region’s subsequent “wettest five- to 10-year period in recorded history.”These dramatic shifts in water levels on Lakes Michigan and Huron will likely become increasingly common, said Michael Notaro, associate director of UW-Madison’s Center for Climatic Research.Beyond speeding up coastal erosion, more frequent, intense storms bring heavier rains that increase the runoff of fertilizer into lakes, feeding algal blooms on nutrient-rich lakes that harm fish and other wildlife.“It’s already happening,” said Notaro.Communities respondSorenson, who at 27 serves as Sheboygan’s youngest-ever mayor, grew up in the lakeside city of 48,000. Sometimes called the Malibu of the Midwest, Sheboygan is home to fleets of charter fishing boats, sandy beaches and surfers who brave winter waters.Sorenson remembers summer days he spent at the beach as a child, swimming, catching fish and building sand castles. And he remembers when rising waters began to wash those beaches away. Wanting to help property owners respond to lakeshore erosion is part of what inspired him to run for mayor, he said in a 2020 campaign video.“In the last few years, we’ve seen tremendously high water impact the business community on the boardwalk, where we’ve had to throw sandbags out there just to try to keep it at bay. And that’s not a long-term solution for our community,” he said.“We’re seeing cliffs just getting washed away, falling into the lake.”Great Lakes communities have spent $878 million in the past two years responding to coastal damage, according to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative. Wisconsin’s expected $245 million in costs over the next five years is conservative, Sorenson said, because the group’s survey doesn’t include every jurisdiction.Shoreline erosion — and paying for infrastructure improvements needed to protect against damage from high water — challenges urban centers and small towns along the Great Lakes.In Door County, about an hour and half north of Sheboygan, marina owners and village crews scrambled to rescue property, limit damage to piers and stack sandbags to protect the town’s buildings after November gales battered the village of Ephraim in 2019. After stones and debris washed onto the road at the south end of the village, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation added several hundred feet of rock alongside the highway to protect it from a future storm surge.Additionally, the village launched a $358,000 project to rebuild a limestone wall and add more shoreline protection near Ephraim’s historic downtown.Examining shoresThe Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has begun an analysis of the Door Peninsula to inform residents on how to grapple with an unpredictable Lake Michigan.Prompting DNR’s analysis: a soaring tally of permitting requests from residents to build barriers during high water years and dredge during low-water years, said James Pardee, DNR environmental analysis and review specialist.For Sheboygan, preparing for the future means reinforcing breakwater areas and adding an additional seawall or protective rock layers called riprap, said Sorenson. It also means planting native vegetation, which stabilizes bluff slopes to help limit erosion.But budgeting for such investments isn’t easy for a mid-size city like Sheboygan. That’s why the mayor hopes to secure federal and state aid.“I can’t do this alone,” Sorenson said. “Whether it’s Sheboygan, Racine, Sturgeon Bay, Green Bay, Marinette, Milwaukee, and everywhere in between, we need to have a clear focus in terms of how we address this.”Jack Kelly contributed to this report.Photos: January 2020 storm damage, erosion along Lake MichiganHouse falling, Jan. 13House falling, Jan. 13A dump truck on Jan. 13 drops stones, boulders and sediment behind a home  decimated by fast-moving erosion along the Lake Michigan shoreline in Pleasant Prairie days before.ADAM ROGAN, JOURNAL TIMES ARCHIVESHouse falling, Jan. 13House falling, Jan. 13A home that was partially destroyed by erosion during Saturday's storm has been deemed uninhabitable by the Village of Pleasant Prairie.

      "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n",
      "&lt;/div&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The results of the referendum that would bring $1 billion over 30 years to the Racine Unified School District — and allow the district to revamp buildings dating back to the Civil War —&amp;nbsp; came down to just five votes.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;On April 7, 2020, voters approved the referendum by this impossibly thin margin. Little more than two weeks later, observers gathered in Festival Hall and held their collective breath as they watched the recount of 33,315 ballots.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Racine Unified School Board president Brian O’Connell said it felt like watching the final seconds of a championship. After six rounds of ballot-counting, the results were final: The referendum had passed.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;It was a hard-fought campaign for the referendum, O’Connell recalled, one that met staunch opposition &lt;a href=\"https://www.hotgovernment.com/\"&gt;from HOT (Honest, Open and Transparent) Government&lt;/a&gt;, the same group that would later challenge the five-vote victory, appealing all the way to the state Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;School officials are awaiting a final verdict from the high court before they break ground on the full slate of projects the referendum money would fund.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Despite its hefty $1 billion price tag, &lt;a href=\"https://rusd.org/sites/default/files/uploads/2020Referendum/Sheets/2020%20Referendum%20General%20Fact%20Sheet%20English.pdf\"&gt;the district says the measure is not projected to increase the property tax rate&lt;/a&gt; — although any increase in assessed value will raise individual tax bills.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;For now, referendum advocates in Racine applaud increased tax dollars that will allow the district to “right-size” by closing under-enrolled schools, refurbishing and expanding others, and adding new technology, including a science, technology, engineering, arts and math school.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;O’Connell said there was no other way to raise the money.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s why you see so many school districts, big and small, urban and rural, going to referendum,” he said. “If you find a school district that’s been able to raise money without going to referendum, please let me know.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Referendum questions common&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, school districts in Wisconsin are forced to ask voters for approval to pay for everything from maintenance of old school buildings and construction of new schools to employee pay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, more than seven out of every 10 of Wisconsin’s 421 school districts have gone to referendum, with &lt;a href=\"https://wispolicyforum.org/school-referenda-in-wisconsin-spring-2020-election-update/\"&gt;two-thirds of those ballot measures passing&lt;/a&gt;, said Ari Brown, a researcher with the Wisconsin Policy Forum.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The frequency with which districts in Wisconsin must exceed state-imposed revenue limits shows the nearly 30-year-old state funding formula is failing to keep up with present-day needs, school officials say.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1993, local school districts generally had the authority to raise as much as they deemed necessary and have the local taxpayers to cover it, with the state covering a certain percentage, Brown said. But that year, the Wisconsin Legislature imposed revenue limits in response to concerns by lawmakers and members of the public about rapidly rising tax bills to fund schools.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The limits are &lt;a href=\"https://gopresstimes.com/2021/05/27/rising-referendums-school-funding-101/\"&gt;based on a complicated formula&lt;/a&gt; that takes into account the assessed property in the district, the size of enrollment and past revenue, Brown said. State aid can decrease as property values increase or if student enrollment decreases.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Places like Gibraltar in Door County rely more heavily on property taxes to pay for schools, because the district is considered “property rich,” with 83.8 percent of its operating budget in 2020 coming from property taxes. Districts like Beloit rely more on state aid, because property taxes cover a smaller percentage, 2.5% of its operating budget in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;And proposals by former state superintendent and current Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to &lt;a href=\"https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/evers-calls-for-special-session-return-to-two-thirds-funding/\"&gt;change the system&lt;/a&gt; — and vastly increase state funding to education — have been rebuffed by the GOP-run Legislature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/School_funding_Seymour-771x514.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1263947\" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Seymour (Wis.) Community School District Superintendent Laurie Asher said the high school is expanding its tech ed department thanks to a referendum passed in April. Like most Wisconsin school districts, Seymour has had to ask voters to approve additional spending to meet district needs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money dries up as enrollment drops&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Brown said while the per pupil state aid has increased over time, the rate has not kept up with inflation. From the 2009-10 school year to 2018-19,&lt;a href=\"https://wispolicyforum.org/research/amid-crisis-voters-again-support-more-money-for-schools/\"&gt; inflation rose 17%, while the state average revenue limit per pupil increased only 6%&lt;/a&gt;, he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;And if a district’s enrollment decreases, the effect on its bottom line can be magnified, said Dale Knapp, director of Forward Analytics, the research arm for the Wisconsin Counties Association.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;“The challenges for school districts is they have a lot of what I would call semi-fixed costs, for example, teachers,” he said. “Suppose your average class size is 25, and you’re a medium-sized district, but you lose 50 students in a year. It’s going to be across multiple grades, so you can’t necessarily in that year lay off two teachers because you have 50 fewer students. ….So your costs don’t decline linearly with enrollment.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Dan Rossmiller, director of government relations for the Wisconsin Association of School Boards, said this dynamic has created funding problems for many districts — one that is difficult to explain to taxpayers who may oppose increasing taxes to pay for schools where enrollments are declining.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;“What’s happened since about the early 2000s is that enrollment has been decreasing,” Rossmiller said. “That’s what’s pinching school district budgets. As enrollment goes down, the state-imposed revenue limit reduces the revenue available to the district. The real problem in explaining this to the public is that every district has a unique situation and a unique explanation.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;A Republican bill that would have made enrollment declines less financially damaging &lt;a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/proposals/ab368\"&gt;failed to pass the Legislature in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School officials: Update funding system&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The Green Bay Area Public School District, the fourth largest district in the state, is no stranger to referendums — going to voters eight times since 1993.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/education/2017/04/05/green-bay-school-referendums-pass-easily/100003048/\"&gt;Its most recent pair passed in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which included $68.25 million for a districtwide building and facilities improvement plan and an operational referendum authorizing the district to exceed the revenue cap by $16.5 million per year for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;“So the revenue cap is what needs to change — pure and simple,” said Pete Ross, the Green Bay district’s chief operations officer. “It has not increased with inflation in any of the years since it’s been put in place.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Ross said the cap has locked Green Bay into a level of spending that no longer supports the district’s needs. In 2017, Green Bay’s per pupil spending was $9,691 — well below the state average of $10,444, district spokeswoman Lori Blakeslee said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;“In 1993, we were fixed as a low-spending district and could not move out of that fixed spot we were in,” Ross said. “So going into the 1993 school year, if you were a poor district, a low-spending district, you were destined to be that forever.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Savion Castro, Madison school board vice president, said even high property value districts like Madison do not fare well under the revenue caps because of the significant needs of some of their students. &lt;a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-voters-approved-84-percent-school-referendums-election\"&gt;The district passed a pair of referendums in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; totaling $350 million — $317 million for capital projects and $33 million in operating funds that will phase in over four years.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/School_funding_LaCroix-771x523.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1263945\" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Howard-Suamico School Superintendent Damian LaCroix flips through minutes from a community meeting held in the Town of Pittsfield, Wis., on Nov. 15, 1856, which created the area’s first school — and the taxes to pay for it. Increasingly, school districts in Wisconsin must seek voter approval for spending when the state revenue cap and funding formula leave them short.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;“We have very, very, very high levels of inequity in our school system. West High School has the highest level of income inequality in the whole state,” Castro said. “Big picture, I think we need to come up with a formula that is reflective of the actual needs of students and the changing demographics that we are seeing in our schools.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;But former Republican state Sen. Luther Olsen, who chaired the Senate Education Committee until 2020, said the nearly 30-year-old funding formula has done the job, curbing what lawmakers and many members of the public felt was unfettered spending by school officials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;“What was happening is that schools were writing checks and the state was having to sign its name on the bottom, and when it said it would fund whatever a school spent, there was no concern,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposals for change stall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Olsen and state Rep. Joel Kitchens, R-Sturgeon Bay, served as co-chairs of the bipartisan &lt;a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/bipartisan-group-lawmakers-recommends-increased-funding-schools#:~:text=The%20Blue%20Ribbon%20Commission%20on,for%20the%20Legislature%20to%20consider.\"&gt;Blue Ribbon Commission on School Funding&lt;/a&gt;. Both are long-time former school board members in northeastern Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the commission put forth &lt;a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/misc/206_recommendations_of_the_blue_ribbon_commission_on_school_funding_1_4_19.pdf\"&gt;20 recommendations for legislative action&lt;/a&gt; — including restoring the state’s commitment of two-thirds funding of school costs, adjusting per-pupil funding with inflation, factoring in the needs of low-income pupils and updating revenue limit formulas. (A complete list of recommendations can be found at &lt;a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/blueribbonrecs\"&gt;tinyurl.com/blueribbonrecs&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The Legislature has taken no action on those proposals, but, said Kitchens, “I would hope that we would still have a chance to get those done this time or in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Another former school board member, state Rep. Kristina Shelton, D-Green Bay, said Wisconsin needs a school funding formula that is “transparent, equitable and sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately,” she said, “what we found is our formula is none of those things, and it is harming Wisconsin kids, families and teachers.”&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District relies on history of public support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Howard-Suamico Superintendent Damian LaCroix keeps a powerful reminder of the past, which he hopes is a sign of the future of public education. Nestled on his office bookshelves are the original minutes from a community meeting held in the Town of Pittsfield on Nov. 15, 1856.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;“The only thing on the agenda was this group recognizing the need if the community was going to prosper and thrive, they needed to invest in their schools,” LaCroix said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/School_funding_old_minutes-771x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1263946\" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Minutes from a community meeting held in the Town of Pittsfield, Wis., on Nov. 15, 1856 show the vote on the area’s first school, and subsequently the tax to fund it. Howard-Suamico School Superintendent Damian LaCroix keeps the records close at hand to remind him of the area’s historical commitment to funding schools.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;On that day, those 17 community members agreed on a $200 tax to build a new school house and a $50 tax to pay for a teacher.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 165 years, and school finance in 2021 is infinitely more complex — and the needs of students and the community have grown to levels unfathomable in the 1800s.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Because Howard-Suamico was a low-spending district back in 1992, it has held nine referendum questions to boost spending since 2005, &lt;a href=\"https://wispolicyforum.org/school-referenda-in-wisconsin-spring-2020-election-update/\"&gt;seven of which passed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Most recently, on April 6, district voters approved &lt;a href=\"https://gopresstimes.com/2021/03/25/the-dollars-and-sense-behind-howard-suamicos-referendum-questions/\"&gt;two referendum questions, including &lt;/a&gt;$98 million to renovate learning spaces and operational funding to decrease class sizes, better compensate teachers and maintain facilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;“Over 160 years ago, leaders in this community recognized education is not an expense, it’s an investment,” LaCroix said. “We have a duty, a moral and ethical obligation, to educate every child and help them maximize their potential.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "The results of the referendum that would bring $1 billion over 30 years to the Racine Unified School District — and allow the district to revamp buildings dating back to the Civil War —  came down to just five votes.\n",
      "On April 7, 2020, voters approved the referendum by this impossibly thin margin. Little more than two weeks later, observers gathered in Festival Hall and held their collective breath as they watched the recount of 33,315 ballots.\n",
      "Racine Unified School Board president Brian O’Connell said it felt like watching the final seconds of a championship. After six rounds of ballot-counting, the results were final: The referendum had passed.\n",
      "It was a hard-fought campaign for the referendum, O’Connell recalled, one that met staunch opposition from HOT (Honest, Open and Transparent) Government, the same group that would later challenge the five-vote victory, appealing all the way to the state Supreme Court.\n",
      "School officials are awaiting a final verdict from the high court before they break ground on the full slate of projects the referendum money would fund.\n",
      "Despite its hefty $1 billion price tag, the district says the measure is not projected to increase the property tax rate — although any increase in assessed value will raise individual tax bills.\n",
      "For now, referendum advocates in Racine applaud increased tax dollars that will allow the district to “right-size” by closing under-enrolled schools, refurbishing and expanding others, and adding new technology, including a science, technology, engineering, arts and math school. \n",
      "O’Connell said there was no other way to raise the money.\n",
      "“I think that’s why you see so many school districts, big and small, urban and rural, going to referendum,” he said. “If you find a school district that’s been able to raise money without going to referendum, please let me know.” \n",
      "Referendum questions common\n",
      "Increasingly, school districts in Wisconsin are forced to ask voters for approval to pay for everything from maintenance of old school buildings and construction of new schools to employee pay. \n",
      "Since 2016, more than seven out of every 10 of Wisconsin’s 421 school districts have gone to referendum, with two-thirds of those ballot measures passing, said Ari Brown, a researcher with the Wisconsin Policy Forum.  \n",
      "The frequency with which districts in Wisconsin must exceed state-imposed revenue limits shows the nearly 30-year-old state funding formula is failing to keep up with present-day needs, school officials say.\n",
      "Prior to 1993, local school districts generally had the authority to raise as much as they deemed necessary and have the local taxpayers to cover it, with the state covering a certain percentage, Brown said. But that year, the Wisconsin Legislature imposed revenue limits in response to concerns by lawmakers and members of the public about rapidly rising tax bills to fund schools.\n",
      "The limits are based on a complicated formula that takes into account the assessed property in the district, the size of enrollment and past revenue, Brown said. State aid can decrease as property values increase or if student enrollment decreases.\n",
      "Places like Gibraltar in Door County rely more heavily on property taxes to pay for schools, because the district is considered “property rich,” with 83.8 percent of its operating budget in 2020 coming from property taxes. Districts like Beloit rely more on state aid, because property taxes cover a smaller percentage, 2.5% of its operating budget in 2020.\n",

      "And proposals by former state superintendent and current Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to change the system — and vastly increase state funding to education — have been rebuffed by the GOP-run Legislature. \n",
      "Seymour (Wis.) Community School District Superintendent Laurie Asher said the high school is expanding its tech ed department thanks to a referendum passed in April. Like most Wisconsin school districts, Seymour has had to ask voters to approve additional spending to meet district needs. Lea Kopke / Press Times\n",
      "Money dries up as enrollment drops \n",
      "Brown said while the per pupil state aid has increased over time, the rate has not kept up with inflation. From the 2009-10 school year to 2018-19, inflation rose 17%, while the state average revenue limit per pupil increased only 6%, he said. \n",
      "And if a district’s enrollment decreases, the effect on its bottom line can be magnified, said Dale Knapp, director of Forward Analytics, the research arm for the Wisconsin Counties Association. \n",
      "“The challenges for school districts is they have a lot of what I would call semi-fixed costs, for example, teachers,” he said. “Suppose your average class size is 25, and you’re a medium-sized district, but you lose 50 students in a year. It’s going to be across multiple grades, so you can’t necessarily in that year lay off two teachers because you have 50 fewer students. ….So your costs don’t decline linearly with enrollment.” \n",
      "Dan Rossmiller, director of government relations for the Wisconsin Association of School Boards, said this dynamic has created funding problems for many districts — one that is difficult to explain to taxpayers who may oppose increasing taxes to pay for schools where enrollments are declining. \n",
      "“What’s happened since about the early 2000s is that enrollment has been decreasing,” Rossmiller said. “That’s what’s pinching school district budgets. As enrollment goes down, the state-imposed revenue limit reduces the revenue available to the district. The real problem in explaining this to the public is that every district has a unique situation and a unique explanation.” \n",
      "A Republican bill that would have made enrollment declines less financially damaging failed to pass the Legislature in 2020.\n",
      "School officials: Update funding system \n",
      "The Green Bay Area Public School District, the fourth largest district in the state, is no stranger to referendums — going to voters eight times since 1993.\n",
      "Its most recent pair passed in 2017, which included $68.25 million for a districtwide building and facilities improvement plan and an operational referendum authorizing the district to exceed the revenue cap by $16.5 million per year for 10 years.\n",
      "“So the revenue cap is what needs to change — pure and simple,” said Pete Ross, the Green Bay district’s chief operations officer. “It has not increased with inflation in any of the years since it’s been put in place.”\n",
      "Ross said the cap has locked Green Bay into a level of spending that no longer supports the district’s needs. In 2017, Green Bay’s per pupil spending was $9,691 — well below the state average of $10,444, district spokeswoman Lori Blakeslee said.\n",
      "“In 1993, we were fixed as a low-spending district and could not move out of that fixed spot we were in,” Ross said. “So going into the 1993 school year, if you were a poor district, a low-spending district, you were destined to be that forever.”\n",
      "Savion Castro, Madison school board vice president, said even high property value districts like Madison do not fare well under the revenue caps because of the significant needs of some of their students. The district passed a pair of referendums in November 2020 totaling $350 million — $317 million for capital projects and $33 million in operating funds that will phase in over four years.\n",
      "Howard-Suamico School Superintendent Damian LaCroix flips through minutes from a community meeting held in the Town of Pittsfield, Wis., on Nov. 15, 1856, which created the area’s first school — and the taxes to pay for it. Increasingly, school districts in Wisconsin must seek voter approval for spending when the state revenue cap and funding formula leave them short. Ben Rodgers / Press Times\n",
      "“We have very, very, very high levels of inequity in our school system. West High School has the highest level of income inequality in the whole state,” Castro said. “Big picture, I think we need to come up with a formula that is reflective of the actual needs of students and the changing demographics that we are seeing in our schools.”\n",
      "But former Republican state Sen. Luther Olsen, who chaired the Senate Education Committee until 2020, said the nearly 30-year-old funding formula has done the job, curbing what lawmakers and many members of the public felt was unfettered spending by school officials. \n",
      "“What was happening is that schools were writing checks and the state was having to sign its name on the bottom, and when it said it would fund whatever a school spent, there was no concern,” he said.\n",
      "Proposals for change stall\n",
      "Olsen and state Rep. Joel Kitchens, R-Sturgeon Bay, served as co-chairs of the bipartisan Blue Ribbon Commission on School Funding. Both are long-time former school board members in northeastern Wisconsin.\n",
      "In 2019, the commission put forth 20 recommendations for legislative action — including restoring the state’s commitment of two-thirds funding of school costs, adjusting per-pupil funding with inflation, factoring in the needs of low-income pupils and updating revenue limit formulas. (A complete list of recommendations can be found at tinyurl.com/blueribbonrecs) \n",
      "The Legislature has taken no action on those proposals, but, said Kitchens, “I would hope that we would still have a chance to get those done this time or in the future.”\n",
      "Another former school board member, state Rep. Kristina Shelton, D-Green Bay, said Wisconsin needs a school funding formula that is “transparent, equitable and sustainable.”\n",
      "“Unfortunately,” she said, “what we found is our formula is none of those things, and it is harming Wisconsin kids, families and teachers.”\n",
      "District relies on history of public support\n",
      "Howard-Suamico Superintendent Damian LaCroix keeps a powerful reminder of the past, which he hopes is a sign of the future of public education. Nestled on his office bookshelves are the original minutes from a community meeting held in the Town of Pittsfield on Nov. 15, 1856.\n",
      "“The only thing on the agenda was this group recognizing the need if the community was going to prosper and thrive, they needed to invest in their schools,” LaCroix said. \n",
      "Minutes from a community meeting held in the Town of Pittsfield, Wis., on Nov. 15, 1856 show the vote on the area’s first school, and subsequently the tax to fund it. Howard-Suamico School Superintendent Damian LaCroix keeps the records close at hand to remind him of the area’s historical commitment to funding schools. Ben Rodgers / Press Times\n",
      "On that day, those 17 community members agreed on a $200 tax to build a new school house and a $50 tax to pay for a teacher. \n",
      "Fast forward 165 years, and school finance in 2021 is infinitely more complex — and the needs of students and the community have grown to levels unfathomable in the 1800s.\n",
      "Because Howard-Suamico was a low-spending district back in 1992, it has held nine referendum questions to boost spending since 2005, seven of which passed. \n",
      "Most recently, on April 6, district voters approved two referendum questions, including $98 million to renovate learning spaces and operational funding to decrease class sizes, better compensate teachers and maintain facilities. \n",
      "“Over 160 years ago, leaders in this community recognized education is not an expense, it’s an investment,” LaCroix said. “We have a duty, a moral and ethical obligation, to educate every child and help them maximize their potential.” \n",

      "<p>Ross said the cap has locked Green Bay into a level of spending that no longer supports the district’s needs. In 2017, Green Bay’s per pupil spending was $9,691 — well below the state average of $10,444, district spokeswoman Lori Blakeslee said.</p>\n",
      "<p>“In 1993, we were fixed as a low-spending district and could not move out of that fixed spot we were in,” Ross said. “So going into the 1993 school year, if you were a poor district, a low-spending district, you were destined to be that forever.”</p>\n",
      "<p>Savion Castro, Madison school board vice president, said even high property value districts like Madison do not fare well under the revenue caps because of the significant needs of some of their students. <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-voters-approved-84-percent-school-referendums-election\">The district passed a pair of referendums in November 2020</a> totaling $350 million — $317 million for capital projects and $33 million in operating funds that will phase in over four years.</p>\n",
      "<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/School_funding_LaCroix-771x523.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1263945\" /><figcaption>Howard-Suamico School Superintendent Damian LaCroix flips through minutes from a community meeting held in the Town of Pittsfield, Wis., on Nov. 15, 1856, which created the area’s first school — and the taxes to pay for it. Increasingly, school districts in Wisconsin must seek voter approval for spending when the state revenue cap and funding formula leave them short.</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "<p>“We have very, very, very high levels of inequity in our school system. West High School has the highest level of income inequality in the whole state,” Castro said. “Big picture, I think we need to come up with a formula that is reflective of the actual needs of students and the changing demographics that we are seeing in our schools.”</p>\n",
      "<p>But former Republican state Sen. Luther Olsen, who chaired the Senate Education Committee until 2020, said the nearly 30-year-old funding formula has done the job, curbing what lawmakers and many members of the public felt was unfettered spending by school officials.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "<p>“What was happening is that schools were writing checks and the state was having to sign its name on the bottom, and when it said it would fund whatever a school spent, there was no concern,” he said.</p>\n",
      "<h3><strong>Proposals for change stall</strong></h3>\n",
      "<p>Olsen and state Rep. Joel Kitchens, R-Sturgeon Bay, served as co-chairs of the bipartisan <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/bipartisan-group-lawmakers-recommends-increased-funding-schools#:~:text=The%20Blue%20Ribbon%20Commission%20on,for%20the%20Legislature%20to%20consider.\">Blue Ribbon Commission on School Funding</a>. Both are long-time former school board members in northeastern Wisconsin.</p>\n",
      "<p>In 2019, the commission put forth <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/misc/206_recommendations_of_the_blue_ribbon_commission_on_school_funding_1_4_19.pdf\">20 recommendations for legislative action</a> — including restoring the state’s commitment of two-thirds funding of school costs, adjusting per-pupil funding with inflation, factoring in the needs of low-income pupils and updating revenue limit formulas. (A complete list of recommendations can be found at <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/blueribbonrecs\">tinyurl.com/blueribbonrecs</a>)&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "<p>The Legislature has taken no action on those proposals, but, said Kitchens, “I would hope that we would still have a chance to get those done this time or in the future.”</p>\n",
      "<p>Another former school board member, state Rep. Kristina Shelton, D-Green Bay, said Wisconsin needs a school funding formula that is “transparent, equitable and sustainable.”</p>\n",
      "<p>“Unfortunately,” she said, “what we found is our formula is none of those things, and it is harming Wisconsin kids, families and teachers.”</p>\n",
      "<h3><strong>District relies on history of public support</strong></h3>\n",
      "<p>Howard-Suamico Superintendent Damian LaCroix keeps a powerful reminder of the past, which he hopes is a sign of the future of public education. Nestled on his office bookshelves are the original minutes from a community meeting held in the Town of Pittsfield on Nov. 15, 1856.</p>\n",
      "<p>“The only thing on the agenda was this group recognizing the need if the community was going to prosper and thrive, they needed to invest in their schools,” LaCroix said.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/School_funding_old_minutes-771x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1263946\" /><figcaption>Minutes from a community meeting held in the Town of Pittsfield, Wis., on Nov. 15, 1856 show the vote on the area’s first school, and subsequently the tax to fund it. Howard-Suamico School Superintendent Damian LaCroix keeps the records close at hand to remind him of the area’s historical commitment to funding schools.</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "<p>On that day, those 17 community members agreed on a $200 tax to build a new school house and a $50 tax to pay for a teacher.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "<p>Fast forward 165 years, and school finance in 2021 is infinitely more complex — and the needs of students and the community have grown to levels unfathomable in the 1800s.</p>\n",
      "<p>Because Howard-Suamico was a low-spending district back in 1992, it has held nine referendum questions to boost spending since 2005, <a href=\"https://wispolicyforum.org/school-referenda-in-wisconsin-spring-2020-election-update/\">seven of which passed.&nbsp;</a></p>\n",
      "<p>Most recently, on April 6, district voters approved <a href=\"https://gopresstimes.com/2021/03/25/the-dollars-and-sense-behind-howard-suamicos-referendum-questions/\">two referendum questions, including </a>$98 million to renovate learning spaces and operational funding to decrease class sizes, better compensate teachers and maintain facilities.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "<p>“Over 160 years ago, leaders in this community recognized education is not an expense, it’s an investment,” LaCroix said. “We have a duty, a moral and ethical obligation, to educate every child and help them maximize their potential.”&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\tWisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism\t\t\t\tAmber Edwards spent most of the last three years trying to find a place she could afford to live.In 2018, Edwards’ landlord told her the Green Bay duplex where she lived with her 2-year-old daughter and her daughter’s father had been sold and that the new owners planned to live there.She found herself selling off possessions, struggling to afford medical care, losing her car and experiencing homelessness — along with feeling like she failed as a mom.Even as she began to get back on her feet with a new job, a cause for celebration could quickly turn into terror. “About three months after I started my position, I had … finally gotten my budget under control and I got a raise,” Edwards said. “And it launched me into another spiral where my rent and FoodShare benefits dropped off immediately. My responsibility for (health care) and rent went up over $600. I lost my food benefits and most of my child care.”For an increasing number of northeastern Wisconsin residents, housing is taking a bigger chunk of their income as rents and home prices rise and the marketplace struggles to build enough affordable units.That is creating a human as well as an economic crisis. Without more single-family homes and apartments, growth could be choked off with employers desperate to fill job openings. The issue, long on the radar of charity organizations, has quickly shot up the priority list of local governments, community groups and business leaders. The city of Green Bay recently set aside money to help encourage the construction of more affordable housing. Nonprofit and community leaders in Brown County and the Fox Cities created special advisory groups to get families back on their feet and into apartments. Development groups have identified housing and high-speed internet as the most critical needs to boost business.“The market, the way it is right now, definitely is shining a spotlight on the lack of available housing,” said Rebecca Deschane, vice president of talent development for New North Inc., a group that focuses on growing the region’s economy. “It’s not that you maybe can’t afford what’s out there, it’s that there’s just not enough.”She remembers the day she dropped her daughter’s father off at St. John’s Homeless Shelter and spent weekends at the Brown County Central Library. Now she’s happy to be standing on her own. She found an apartment where she’s been able to reunite her household, and she landed a full-time, customer service job. She’s also helping others chart their own path to self-sufficiency. Her struggle, though, isn’t far from her mind. “It took me three years to get there, and I live in constant fear of it all falling apart. It doesn’t go away, the fear, the anger, the trauma. I still work two jobs. I still live paycheck to paycheck. And I know for absolutely certain that I will take care of my daughter and I will be fine. But the fear of losing it all all over again will never go away.”The state’s ALICE population is growing fast, up 42% between 2007 and 2018, to almost 550,000 households.More than one in 10 of those families live in just two counties in northeastern Wisconsin: Brown and Outagamie account for 58,000 homes where people live above poverty but their income isn’t enough to make ends meet.Those families face tough financial choices that can have a spiraling effect on their lives. The hardship caused by a lack of affordable housing is especially painful in places like Brown County where a growing population adds pressure to a construction market that hasn’t kept up with demand. The need is particularly strong for quality apartments and homes that won’t cost families more than 30% of their annual income. What’s significant about 30%?That’s the amount the federal government figures a household can spend on housing and still have enough left over for other basic needs and discretionary spending. If you spend more than 30% of your income on housing, you are considered “housing cost burdened.”\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour contribution is appreciated.\t\t\t\t\t\tThe burden has grown as incomes have failed to keep pace with housing costs. In Brown and Outagamie counties, for instance, rents increased more than 50% since 2000 while median household income rose about 30%. Meanwhile, the housing industry, battered by the crash during the Great Recession a decade ago, focused on building upper-end homes, condos and apartments.“Any new construction on the market is out of reach for a low- or moderate-income family,” notes John Weyenberg, president and CEO of Fox Cities Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit that helps families transition into home ownership.Chuck Andrews, of Menasha, knows the dilemma all too well.The 35-year-old traffic coordinator at Woodward Radio Group has been living with a roommate while looking for a place for himself and his 2-year-old daughter. For more than two years, he’s searched for a well-kept one- or two-bedroom Fox Valley apartment for around $500 to $600 where he can help raise his daughter.“I’m missing out on so much time with (my daughter) simply because I don’t have the space,” Andrews said. “It’s really depressing and stressful.”One of the biggest barriers he’s encountered is his credit score, which he said is not the best. Adding to the challenge is his salary: He makes too much to qualify for rental assistance or low-income housing, but not enough to afford the new, luxury units being added to the market.“What I’m finding is, there’s all these great apartments out there, but they’re all low-income places, and I make just, just too much to be qualified for low-income, but not enough to get a place of my own,” Andrews said.The construction of luxury apartments hasn’t gone unnoticed by advocacy groups and individuals looking for better places to live that fit their budgets.In the Green Bay area, newer apartment buildings offer rents starting around $900 for a studio and $1,600 for a two-bedroom. Apartments in the Green Bay Packers’ almost-completed Titletown Flats building start at $1,395 a month for a 438-square-foot studio apartment and max out at $3,495 a month for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom unit. In Appleton’s River Heath development, a one-bedroom unit rents for $1,275 while a two-bedroom unit starts at $1,800.“It doesn’t make sense. Why are we building all these nice looking apartments if we have people living on sidewalks and on the street and in the park?” asked Eva Cruz of Casa ALBA Melanie, a resource center founded in 2012 that helps the Green Bay area’s Latino community connect with services and assistance programs.Cruz and Maria Plascencia answered the deluge of calls to Casa ALBA Melanie from Latino families seeking help with housing that began in March 2020 as the coronavirus hit the region’s Latino community hard. In some cases, whole families were infected with COVID-19 at one time and struggled to continue working to afford housing, food and other basic needs. Special donations helped Casa ALBA provide cash assistance to more than 200 of the most vulnerable families, but even some housing units with rents below $1,000 are too expensive for families working long hours for low wages. “Families are struggling both with or without assistance,” Cruz said. “And the new units are still not affordable to people. Nine hundred dollars is too much for a family of four or five. They do not make enough to afford them. It’s not reasonable.”Some groups of people bear a disproportionate share of the shortage. Median wage data shows Black, Latino, Asian and women workers make significantly less than white men in the region. United Way of Wisconsin found a disproportionate number of such households fall below the ALICE threshold, as well. Still, Samantha Oscar, a psychologist at We All Rise who also handles housing assistance, said the organization has a binder full of applications from families who still need help with suitable housing. They prioritize cases where families are sleeping in their car or a motel. People in northeastern Wisconsin said they often suspect they are victims of housing discrimination because of the color of their skin or their ethnicity.  Marion Scott of Oshkosh tried for about two months to find a larger two-bedroom apartment than the one she has lived in for the last five years. She eventually gave up, convinced that past financial troubles and racial discrimination were too large a hurdle.She acknowledges her search was complicated by the fact that she fell on hard times in the past that resulted in several misdemeanors and evictions, but she’s since turned her life around. Still, it seemed landlords were hesitant to give her a chance even though she had a steady job and solid recent rental history. Scott, 60, suspects that’s because she’s Black. “When people see that I’m Black, they don’t want to rent to me,” Scott said. ‘That’s how I feel, because what other reason could there be? If you have a good job, even offer to pay two months’ security deposit, they still don’t want you? They seem to look for reasons not to rent to you.”Scott said she was never late with her rent during the five years she’s lived in her current apartment. She had a stable job as a certified nursing assistant at the Wisconsin Veterans Home at King until she recently hurt her back at work. She had saved up enough money for a security deposit and several months’ rent before she began looking for two-bedroom apartments with rents between $600 and $800 a month.But she became so frustrated after she was repeatedly rejected for apartments that she decided to stay at her current place and save money to buy a house. Employers in the region cite retaining and recruiting workers as their top priority, and housing is “a piece of the puzzle,” said Kelly Armstrong, the Greater Green Bay Chamber’s vice president of economic development. She noted the need spans price ranges and that companies have recognized they can remove barriers to employment if they get creative with incentives such as child care.  “We certainly see a trend with employers thinking outside of the box when it comes to the whole package (for employees),” Armstrong said. “Employers are looking at more comprehensive strategies that remove barriers to employment.”“Employers used to not worry about housing at all. As more and more of them see the challenge to recruiting tied to this, they’re starting to wonder if they need to play a role in that,” notes Noel Halvorsen, president and CEO of NeighborWorks Green Bay, an agency that prepares families for home ownership, provides financial assistance to low-income families and develops affordable apartments and homes.The sheer number of housing units communities need to build is only half the challenge. Spikes in material and labor costs have made the idea of building out of the shortage less feasible. Additionally, local zoning and land use rules limit opportunities to build less expensive and higher-density housing affordable to lower income households. “There’s just people who can’t find homes,” Halvorsen said. “We’ve got to build more, build different, and we’re being stymied by high construction costs, a lack of land to develop. Every community has different rules and regulations.” Edwards said families working their way out of homelessness face a similar challenge navigating the aid system and impossible choices between food, car repairs, housing, child care and health care.“It launched us into so many layers of conflict and problems. Navigating the system, the appointments, the classes … all of it was just a nightmare,” she said. “It really was. Without the resources available in this community, I was very, very close to just walking away and going home (to Indiana), packing up my family and going home because I felt this city had failed me.”She qualified for a Section 8 housing voucher through a federal housing program that subsidizes rent for lower income families, but she couldn’t find a landlord who accepted the voucher.Edwards eventually talked a landlord into accepting a housing voucher in 2020 and again has adequate housing for herself, as well as her co-parent and her daughter, now 5. Her Circles Green Bay support network, with her since she started in April 2018, connected her to help applying for jobs and reliable transportation. She graduated Circles last summer and has navigated the loss of vital benefits that comes with growing wages.Edwards wasn’t done with Circles, though. In December, she was hired part-time as a trainer. Her first group graduates June 14. “Three years ago, I sat in that training room broken and homeless and having no idea what I was going to do about it,” she said. “I get to stand in that same space today and help other people find their strength. This is my chance to make sure it doesn’t happen to anybody else.”Our homes are our refuge, a source of safety and security, and often our biggest investment. But for more and more families in northeastern Wisconsin, that safety and security are undercut by a desperate search for an affordable home to buy or rent.One of every three households in the region struggles to afford basic needs: shelter, food, technology, transportation and health care. Local businesses have a hard enough time finding workers; that task is harder when potential employees can’t find a decent place to live.Journalists from The Post-Crescent in Appleton and the Green Bay Press-Gazette, as part of a collaboration called the NEW (Northeast Wisconsin) News Lab, interviewed experts and people with firsthand experience to reveal how this housing shortage became a crisis, what it will take to resolve it, and how it impacts the people who live through it every day.Republish This StoryRepublish our articles for free, online or in print, under a Creative Commons license.This <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/2021/06/how-a-lack-of-affordable-housing-crimps-lives-economy-in-northeast-wisconsin/\">article</a> first appeared on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org\">WisconsinWatch.org</a> and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cropped-WCIJ_IconOnly_FullColor_RGB-1.png?fit=150%2C150&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:1em;height:1em;margin-left:10px;\"><img id=\"republication-tracker-tool-source\" src=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/?republication-pixel=true&post=1263713&ga=UA-17896820-1\" style=\"width:1px;height:1px;\">Jeff Bollier is a St. Louis native whose 19 years in Wisconsin almost qualify him for resident status.

      "<p><em>Wisconsin Watch</em></p> /n\n",
      "<p>As a child protective services worker questioned them in their baby’s hospital room, Greg and Katie Shebesta of Janesville, Wisconsin, held their nearly 6-month-old upright, allowing the excess fluid to drip through tubes a brain surgeon had inserted beneath his skull.<br/><br/>“He was trying to understand if I was a person who would hurt my child,” Katie Shebesta said.<br/><br/>Greg Shebesta remembered a torrent of fear washing over him that winter day seven years ago.<br/><br/>“I was afraid my kid was gonna die. I was afraid I was gonna go to jail. I was afraid they were gonna take them away from us,” he said, referring to Henry and his older brother Jack, who was 3 years old.<br/><br/>Dr. Barbara Knox, then-head of the University of Wisconsin’s Child Protection Program, had flagged the Shebestas’ case, alleging the baby’s brain bleeding was intentionally inflicted. That triggered an investigation that began even before Henry’s surgery.<br/><br/>Greg Shebesta researched possible medical reasons for his son’s condition on the internet. He shared his findings with Knox. She rebuffed them.<br/><br/>“Dr. Knox kept saying, ‘No, there’s no medical reason, this was intentional trauma, nonaccidental trauma,’ ” he recalled.<br/><br/>But Knox was wrong. And not just in that case. </p> /n\n",
      "<p>In seven cases spanning seven years, the child abuse pediatrician labeled accidents and medical conditions as abuse — allegations later rejected by police, child protection officials and other doctors, Wisconsin Watch has found. They are among the families and caregivers who spoke to Wisconsin Watch after a 2020 investigation revealed Knox had <a href=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/2020/02/child-abuse-doctor-bullying/\">wrongly suspected a Mount Horeb family of child abuse</a>.</p> /n\n",
      "<p><strong>Blood clotting disorder blamed</strong></p> /n\n",
      "<p>Months after Henry recovered from brain surgery, a UW pediatric hematologist and oncologist told them Henry had a blood clotting disorder.<br/><br/>The brain bleeds that Henry suffered “very likely are entirely due to this bleeding tendency,” Dr. Carol Diamond wrote in a letter she sent in February 2015 to Knox and Rock County child protective services. She added: “I feel very confident in the care of this family for this boy.”<br/><br/>With the allegations behind them, the parents of now three healthy children detailed what Katie Shebesta called “some of the scariest and most traumatic” moments of their lives. The family would like to see accountability by the hospital — and by Knox — for the unnecessary trauma they endured.</p> /n\n",
      "<p>“She was trying to prove (abuse) all at the expense of potentially our freedom, but more importantly, our kid’s life,” Greg Shebesta said.</p> /n\n",
      "<p><br/>Knox left the University of Wisconsin in 2019, after being <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OcM4_fVy4D9VFbaGw41DRP808HwvMvpF/view?usp=sharing\">suspended for allegedly bullying</a> her hospital colleagues and now faces similar scrutiny at her new job at Providence Alaska Medical Center, where she heads the statewide child abuse forensic clinic, Alaska CARES.<br/><br/>Over the past two years, the Anchorage clinic has lost its entire medical staff to resignations or eliminated positions, according to a <a href=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/2021/11/mass-exodus-at-alaska-child-abuse-clinic-as-former-wisconsin-doctor-accused-of-bullying-misdiagnoses/\">joint investigation</a> by Wisconsin Watch and the Anchorage Daily News. Seven current and former Providence employees say they made dozens of complaints about Knox’s management and medical judgment to supervisors, with no response for months. Knox reportedly has been placed on leave. Providence declined to verify Knox’s employment status but confirmed it is investigating the clinic’s workplace environment.</p> /n\n",
      "<p><br/>Months ahead of publication, Wisconsin Watch sent Knox two emails containing investigative findings, questions and interview requests. She did not respond to emails or follow-up phone calls from Wisconsin Watch.<br/><br/>During Knox’s UW tenure, criminal and child welfare investigations upended the lives of many innocent families. Some cases mandated 24-hour in-home supervision for weeks as CPS and police investigations failed to find evidence to sustain Knox’s suspicions of child abuse.<br/><br/>Dane County Director of Human Services Shawn Tessmann said the CPS system is designed to have multiple checks and balances. She said abuse is substantiated in just 15% of cases referred.<br/><br/>“We are concerned that families are not unduly brought into the CPS system while also making sure that necessary protections are in place for kids who are at risk,” Tessmann said.<br/><br/>Directors of Human Services in Dane, Green and Rock counties, the three counties where all of the families lived at the time of their CPS referral, all said they use an initial assessment based on state standards to determine if the safety and wellbeing of a child are at risk. </p> /n\n",
      "<p>Mandated reporters like Knox who claim they see signs of abuse trigger the CPS assessments. None would comment on their interactions with Knox.<br/><br/>“Only after this assessment is it determined if the allegation is substantiated or not based on the facts gathered,” Tessmann said.<br/><br/>UW Health told Wisconsin Watch it doesn’t track the number of referrals its child protection program makes to child welfare authorities and law enforcement each year. However, all of the parents and caregivers who spoke to Wisconsin Watch were seen by Knox, Physician Assistant Amanda Palm, another member of the child protection team, or both. Some families asked for their names to be withheld because of the stigma of child abuse, fear of losing their jobs or the lingering trauma from the allegations.<br/><br/>The hospital declined interview requests on behalf of staff and administrators.</p> /n\n",
      "<p><strong>Families faced wrongful charges <br/></strong><br/>Knox’s pursuit of allegations against them caused emotional trauma, unnecessary legal and medical bills and at least one initially missed diagnosis, parents told Wisconsin Watch. In the case of Henry’s clotting disorder, the focus on a child abuse diagnosis over the actual cause of his brain bleeding could have threatened his life, the Shebestas say.<br/><br/>These parents came under suspicion under a <a href=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/UW-Child-Protection-Program-Guidelines2019update_redacted.pdf\">policy</a> advising that most bruising or fractures should trigger a child abuse assessment for babies who cannot yet walk or pull themselves up to stand. Knox helped write that policy, which a spokesperson said is based on national standards.</p> /n\n",
      "<p>There are around 350 child abuse pediatricians at hospitals across the country responsible for determining whether a child’s symptoms indicate intentional harm. Knox is a prominent member of the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/do-no-harm\">increasingly controversial</a> subspecialty. She is often a speaker at national conferences and an expert witness in criminal cases across the country.<br/><br/>The Wisconsin Department of Children and Families reported over <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hS-F3ZQejsSkGTnaLBMScSG4l0miBjRw/edit?disco=AAAARZsAuP8\">4,900 confirmed</a> child maltreatment cases in 2019. Within the four types of child maltreatment tracked — neglect, physical, mental and emotional abuse — the majority are attributed to neglect. Physical abuse ranked second; DCF reported just under <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hS-F3ZQejsSkGTnaLBMScSG4l0miBjRw&amp;disco=AAAARZsAuPs\">800 substantiated cases</a> in 2019.</p> /n\n",
      "<p><br/>While Wisconsin law requires doctors to report suspected child maltreatment and gives any mandated reporter immunity from legal repercussions when reports are made in good faith, consequences for a doctor misdiagnosing child abuse remain elusive.<br/><br/>Medical experts who often defend caregivers in court told Wisconsin Watch the child abuse pediatrics subspecialty lacks accountability and scientific rigor, a conclusion also reached by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/do-no-harm\">Do No Harm</a>, an NBC News/Houston Chronicle investigation, which uncovered hundreds of cases of false allegations leveled by child abuse pediatricians.<br/><br/><strong>Mom’s worry turns to charges of abuse</strong><strong><br/></strong></p> /n\n",
      "<p>In 2018, Kimberly Marshall had taken her 7-month-old son Marshall Hass to two separate doctor appointments, reporting a persistent fever and a “crackling” sound in his lungs. One appointment was at UW Health’s emergency department, where doctors declared nothing was out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>But the mother of four knew something was wrong. </p> /n\n",
      "<p>An X-ray at her family pediatrician’s office revealed a broken rib. A doctor told her the fracture was indicative of child abuse, and Marshall came under suspicion as the cause of the injury.<br/><br/>The Madison pediatrician’s office where Marshall had taken all four of her children for over 15 years rushed her and the baby to American Family Children’s Hospital. Police met her in the lobby.<br/><br/>“It was really upsetting because it just turned into this: ‘You’re an abuser,’ ” Marshall said, tearing up as she recounted the incident.<br/><br/>Knox and Palm asked her how she lifted the baby’s car seat and whether she was violent. The pair said the only way her baby could have suffered a broken rib was from abuse or some kind of trauma, like a car accident, Marshall recalled.<br/><br/>The only thing Marshall could offer was that the baby had rolled off a couch and onto a carpet a week earlier while she was in the shower and his older siblings were watching him.<br/><br/>“I honestly don’t know how he broke his rib,” Marshall told Wisconsin Watch.<br/><br/>Knox wrote in the baby’s medical record: “ . . . the fact that the fracture is unexplained further raises concern for physical abuse of a child.”<br/><br/>They told Marshall she could not be alone with her other children while authorities investigated her son’s case.<br/><br/>Further complicating matters, Marshall’s husband, Tim Hass, was stuck in Texas, being debriefed after a one-year deployment to the Middle East. Once the case escalated to a child abuse investigation, the helicopter crew chief for Wisconsin’s Army National Guard grabbed an expedited trip home.<br/></p> /n\n",
      "<p>Police and CPS asked Kimberly if they could go to her home while she was still in the emergency room with the baby and interview her three older children who were ages 11, 12 and 14 at the time. She said yes. More testing revealed nothing else was wrong with her son.<br/><br/>Marshall described feeling “like a captive” in the hospital.<br/><br/>“At no point did they say that I could decline these things, or that the hospital would pay for them,” Marshall said. “It really seemed like if I didn’t do absolutely all these things that I wouldn’t be allowed to leave, and they would take my child.”</p> /n\n",
      "<p><br/>The couple got a lawyer who told them to follow up with their own pediatrician instead of Knox and directed CPS to communicate with him instead.<br/><br/>Dane County’s child protective services closed the case after finding no evidence of abuse.<br/><br/>“It must be terrible for people who don’t have the same resources we do,” Marshall said.<br/><br/><strong>Video clears Madison parents</strong></p> /n\n",
      "<p><br/>In another case, a Madison mom in 2015 was in the same room as her toddler, and his dad was one room away, when they heard him cry out in pain. He had fallen into the side of the couch and began favoring his left arm. The parents rushed him to West Towne Clinic, a UW Health urgent care clinic, where X-rays revealed a break in the boy’s left arm. The clinic sent the family to UW’s emergency department.</p> /n\n",
      "<p>There, a radiologist said the break showed signs of healing, prompting emergency medicine Dr. Michael Kim to ask the boy’s parents when their son had broken his arm the first time. Kim noted in his report the parents told him they didn’t know their son had an old injury.<br/><br/>Because the child’s injury was unexplained, Kim consulted with the Child Protection Program. He told authorities the case was low risk for abuse. He added that Knox would be unable to determine the exact cause of the injury.<br/><br/>After a follow-up appointment with the child protection team six days later, Knox and Palm diagnosed the case as “gravely concerning for nonaccidental trauma.”<br/><br/>Palm told Madison Police Detective Matthew Nordquist, if not for the age of the break, the parents would not be under investigation. Delaying medical care is a form of child neglect under Wisconsin law.<br/><br/>Nordquist asked Palm if it was possible the boy could have injured his arm without his parents knowing. Palm did not give him a definitive answer, according to his police report.<br/><br/>“There’s no way that he could have just hidden it from us for 10 days,” said the boy’s mother, who witnessed nothing out of the ordinary leading up to her son’s injury. She asked not to be named because she also works for the University of Wisconsin.<br/><br/>The parents cleared themselves by showing Nordquist footage from the child’s bedroom camera. Nordquist reviewed the videos of the week before the fall, and wrote in his report he saw the boy “gripping toys with his left hand, using it to balance, putting his body weight on it, and using both hands to climb onto furniture as he plays,” and “never observed him favor his arm, look at his arm or show any expression of pain.”</p> /n\n",
      "<p>The detective closed the case saying he believed the parents sought care as soon as they saw any sign of injury. </p> /n\n",
      "<p id=\"h-mark-on-skin-triggers-abuse-claimafter-their-5-month-old-s-constant-drooling-irritated-and-cracked-the-skin-on-his-chest-his-parents-sought-medical-care-but-their-pediatrician-s-colleague-who-saw-the-baby-that-day-instead-focused-on-a-mark-on-his-left-arm\"><strong>Mark on skin triggers abuse claim</strong><em><br/></em><em><br/></em>After their 5-month-old’s constant drooling irritated and cracked the skin on his chest, his parents sought medical care. But their pediatrician’s colleague, who saw the baby that day, instead focused on a mark on his left arm.<br/></p> /n\n",
      "<p>The pediatrician referred the family, who lived in Madison at the time, to UW Health’s child protection team for over four hours of extensive testing that included an eye exam and an attempted but failed blood draw. The baby “had bruises all over his arms from all the needle sticks,” his mother recalled.<br/><br/>The baby’s mother, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, who knew this mark was from her son’s habit of sucking on his arm, was told that “ ‘Kids won’t do that when they’re six months old.’ ”<br/><br/>In medical records, Palm wrote the “case is being diagnosed as gravely concerning for physical abuse,” and that Knox reviewed the case and agreed.<br/></p> /n\n",
      "<p>A police officer and CPS worker closed their cases after witnessing the baby repeatedly sucking his left arm in the hospital.<br/><br/>The parents asked to remain anonymous because of the stigma of child abuse allegations.</p> /n\n",
      "<p><strong>False medical info given to authorities</strong></p> /n\n",
      "<p>The Shebestas first brought Henry to the UW because their pediatrician sent them there. The doctor treated Henry during an episode of flu-like symptoms that did not resolve and after an MRI found bleeding on the baby’s brain.<br/><br/>He warned the parents that UW doctors would question them as a matter of protocol because they had no explanation for the bleeding. He told the Shebestas he would vouch for them.<br/><br/>Dr. Bermans Iskandar, who led a team of neurosurgeons caring for Henry, reported finding bilateral “chronic subdural collections,” or bleeding, on both sides of the baby’s brain. Henry would eventually have a successful surgery to alleviate the bleeding.<br/></p> /n\n",
      "<p>The day before the surgery, the Shebestas were referred to the hospital’s child protection team. During the couple’s initial interviews, a detective and a CPS worker delivered shocking new — and false — information about their son’s condition. </p> /n\n",
      "<p>Greg Shebesta remembered a detective said Henry had three distinct brain bleeds that occurred on three separate days. Someone, they were told, had intentionally harmed their son, and he was now brain damaged. They suggested the child’s caregiver could be to blame, but the Shebestas insisted the woman — whom they trusted completely — would never harm Henry.<br/><br/>“This was the first time we had heard this information, and it devastated both of us,” Katie Shebesta wrote in a letter to hospital officials that the couple did not send out of fear of retaliation.<br/><br/>When they returned to Henry’s hospital room, neurosurgeon Iskandar was prepping Henry for a bedside procedure. They asked him if what they just heard was true. </p> /n\n",
      "<p>Iskandar refuted the statements and went to find Knox. They would later learn Knox had not consulted with the neurologist before she gave authorities incorrect medical information.<br/><br/>Confused and wanting answers, the couple requested a conference with Knox on their second night in the hospital. They said after she showed up hours late, Knox explained that Henry’s case was not clear cut because there was no sign of injury.<br/><br/>Greg Shebesta asked Knox when the child abuse inquiry would end. The Shebestas both clearly recall Knox’s answer: ??When someone feels guilty enough to confess.</p> /n\n",
      "<p><br/>Knox’s team ran a battery of tests, which found Henry suffered no broken bones or bleeding behind his eyes. In her report, Knox noted Henry’s Factor XIII blood clotting test result came back “mildly low,” the same blood clotting deficit, Dr. Carol Diamond later said, “very likely” caused Henry’s brain bleeds.</p> /n\n",
      "<p>Yet, Knox concluded: “The case remains gravely concerning for nonaccidental trauma as the mechanism of injury.”<br/></p> /n\n",
      "<p>CPS closed the Shebestas’ case, but only after two months of weekly in-home visits, sometimes unannounced, to scrutinize the parents.<br/><br/>“People say, ‘What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.’ And we’re not better for it,” Greg Shebesta said.<br/><br/>He said the experience left him emotionally drained. “I felt dead inside.”<br/></p> /n\n",
      "<p>And for a time, he set up a video camera in the family’s living room and turned it on when his wife wasn’t home. <br/>Instead of filming precious family memories, Greg Shebesta collected evidence — in case he was ever wrongfully accused of child abuse again.</p> /n\n",

      "As a child protective services worker questioned them in their baby’s hospital room, Greg and Katie Shebesta of Janesville, Wisconsin, held their nearly 6-month-old upright, allowing the excess fluid to drip through tubes a brain surgeon had inserted beneath his skull.“He was trying to understand if I was a person who would hurt my child,” Katie Shebesta said.Greg Shebesta remembered a torrent of fear washing over him that winter day seven years ago.“I was afraid my kid was gonna die. I was afraid I was gonna go to jail. I was afraid they were gonna take them away from us,” he said, referring to Henry and his older brother Jack, who was 3 years old.Dr. Barbara Knox, then-head of the University of Wisconsin’s Child Protection Program, had flagged the Shebestas’ case, alleging the baby’s brain bleeding was intentionally inflicted. That triggered an investigation that began even before Henry’s surgery.Greg Shebesta researched possible medical reasons for his son’s condition on the internet. He shared his findings with Knox. She rebuffed them.“Dr. Knox kept saying, ‘No, there’s no medical reason, this was intentional trauma, nonaccidental trauma,’ ” he recalled.But Knox was wrong. And not just in that case. \n",
      "In seven cases spanning seven years, the child abuse pediatrician labeled accidents and medical conditions as abuse — allegations later rejected by police, child protection officials and other doctors, Wisconsin Watch has found. They are among the families and caregivers who spoke to Wisconsin Watch after a 2020 investigation revealed Knox had wrongly suspected a Mount Horeb family of child abuse.\n",
      "Kimberly Marshall, Tim Hass and Marshall Hass, 4, are seen at their home in Middleton, Wis., on Oct. 16, 2021. In January 2018, Kimberly took her infant son Marshall to a clinic to investigate excessive fussiness and a “crackling” sound she heard in his lungs. An X-ray revealed a cracked rib, and she was sent to American Family Children’s Hospital. There Dr. Barbara Knox and Physician Assistant Amanda Palm interrogated her. Marshall was then investigated for abuse by Child Protective Services and the police but eventually cleared. (Coburn Dukehart / Wisconsin Watch)\n",
      "Blood clotting disorder blamed\n",
      "Months after Henry recovered from brain surgery, a UW pediatric hematologist and oncologist told them Henry had a blood clotting disorder.The brain bleeds that Henry suffered “very likely are entirely due to this bleeding tendency,” Dr. Carol Diamond wrote in a letter she sent in February 2015 to Knox and Rock County child protective services. She added: “I feel very confident in the care of this family for this boy.”With the allegations behind them, the parents of now three healthy children detailed what Katie Shebesta called “some of the scariest and most traumatic” moments of their lives. The family would like to see accountability by the hospital — and by Knox — for the unnecessary trauma they endured.\n",
      "“She was trying to prove (abuse) all at the expense of potentially our freedom, but more importantly, our kid’s life,” Greg Shebesta said.\n",
      "Knox left the University of Wisconsin in 2019, after being suspended for allegedly bullying her hospital colleagues and now faces similar scrutiny at her new job at Providence Alaska Medical Center, where she heads the statewide child abuse forensic clinic, Alaska CARES.Over the past two years, the Anchorage clinic has lost its entire medical staff to resignations or eliminated positions, according to a joint investigation by Wisconsin Watch and the Anchorage Daily News. Seven current and former Providence employees say they made dozens of complaints about Knox’s management and medical judgment to supervisors, with no response for months. Knox reportedly has been placed on leave. Providence declined to verify Knox’s employment status but confirmed it is investigating the clinic’s workplace environment.\n",
      "Months ahead of publication, Wisconsin Watch sent Knox two emails containing investigative findings, questions and interview requests. She did not respond to emails or follow-up phone calls from Wisconsin Watch.During Knox’s UW tenure, criminal and child welfare investigations upended the lives of many innocent families. Some cases mandated 24-hour in-home supervision for weeks as CPS and police investigations failed to find evidence to sustain Knox’s suspicions of child abuse.Dane County Director of Human Services Shawn Tessmann said the CPS system is designed to have multiple checks and balances. She said abuse is substantiated in just 15% of cases referred.“We are concerned that families are not unduly brought into the CPS system while also making sure that necessary protections are in place for kids who are at risk,” Tessmann said.Directors of Human Services in Dane, Green and Rock counties, the three counties where all of the families lived at the time of their CPS referral, all said they use an initial assessment based on state standards to determine if the safety and wellbeing of a child are at risk. \n",
      "Mandated reporters like Knox who claim they see signs of abuse trigger the CPS assessments. None would comment on their interactions with Knox.“Only after this assessment is it determined if the allegation is substantiated or not based on the facts gathered,” Tessmann said.UW Health told Wisconsin Watch it doesn’t track the number of referrals its child protection program makes to child welfare authorities and law enforcement each year. However, all of the parents and caregivers who spoke to Wisconsin Watch were seen by Knox, Physician Assistant Amanda Palm, another member of the child protection team, or both. Some families asked for their names to be withheld because of the stigma of child abuse, fear of losing their jobs or the lingering trauma from the allegations.The hospital declined interview requests on behalf of staff and administrators.\n",
      "Doctors at the University of Wisconsin are told to suspect child abuse when children are seen with “sentinel” injuries, including bruises, breaks and burns. The guidance recommends screening for child abuse in children who are not yet able to walk or pull themselves up to stand. (UW School of Medicine and Public Health)\n",
      "Families faced wrongful charges Knox’s pursuit of allegations against them caused emotional trauma, unnecessary legal and medical bills and at least one initially missed diagnosis, parents told Wisconsin Watch. In the case of Henry’s clotting disorder, the focus on a child abuse diagnosis over the actual cause of his brain bleeding could have threatened his life, the Shebestas say.These parents came under suspicion under a policy advising that most bruising or fractures should trigger a child abuse assessment for babies who cannot yet walk or pull themselves up to stand. Knox helped write that policy, which a spokesperson said is based on national standards.\n",
      "There are around 350 child abuse pediatricians at hospitals across the country responsible for determining whether a child’s symptoms indicate intentional harm. Knox is a prominent member of the increasingly controversial subspecialty. She is often a speaker at national conferences and an expert witness in criminal cases across the country.The Wisconsin Department of Children and Families reported over 4,900 confirmed child maltreatment cases in 2019. Within the four types of child maltreatment tracked — neglect, physical, mental and emotional abuse — the majority are attributed to neglect. Physical abuse ranked second; DCF reported just under 800 substantiated cases in 2019.\n",
      "While Wisconsin law requires doctors to report suspected child maltreatment and gives any mandated reporter immunity from legal repercussions when reports are made in good faith, consequences for a doctor misdiagnosing child abuse remain elusive.Medical experts who often defend caregivers in court told Wisconsin Watch the child abuse pediatrics subspecialty lacks accountability and scientific rigor, a conclusion also reached by Do No Harm, an NBC News/Houston Chronicle investigation, which uncovered hundreds of cases of false allegations leveled by child abuse pediatricians.Mom’s worry turns to charges of abuse\n",
      "In 2018, Kimberly Marshall had taken her 7-month-old son Marshall Hass to two separate doctor appointments, reporting a persistent fever and a “crackling” sound in his lungs. One appointment was at UW Health’s emergency department, where doctors declared nothing was out of the ordinary.But the mother of four knew something was wrong. \n",
      "An X-ray at her family pediatrician’s office revealed a broken rib. A doctor told her the fracture was indicative of child abuse, and Marshall came under suspicion as the cause of the injury.The Madison pediatrician’s office where Marshall had taken all four of her children for over 15 years rushed her and the baby to American Family Children’s Hospital. Police met her in the lobby.“It was really upsetting because it just turned into this: ‘You’re an abuser,’ ” Marshall said, tearing up as she recounted the incident.Knox and Palm asked her how she lifted the baby’s car seat and whether she was violent. The pair said the only way her baby could have suffered a broken rib was from abuse or some kind of trauma, like a car accident, Marshall recalled.The only thing Marshall could offer was that the baby had rolled off a couch and onto a carpet a week earlier while she was in the shower and his older siblings were watching him.“I honestly don’t know how he broke his rib,” Marshall told Wisconsin Watch.Knox wrote in the baby’s medical record: “ . . . the fact that the fracture is unexplained further raises concern for physical abuse of a child.”They told Marshall she could not be alone with her other children while authorities investigated her son’s case.Further complicating matters, Marshall’s husband, Tim Hass, was stuck in Texas, being debriefed after a one-year deployment to the Middle East. Once the case escalated to a child abuse investigation, the helicopter crew chief for Wisconsin’s Army National Guard grabbed an expedited trip home.\n",
      "Police and CPS asked Kimberly if they could go to her home while she was still in the emergency room with the baby and interview her three older children who were ages 11, 12 and 14 at the time. She said yes. More testing revealed nothing else was wrong with her son.Marshall described feeling “like a captive” in the hospital.“At no point did they say that I could decline these things, or that the hospital would pay for them,” Marshall said. “It really seemed like if I didn’t do absolutely all these things that I wouldn’t be allowed to leave, and they would take my child.”\n",
      "The couple got a lawyer who told them to follow up with their own pediatrician instead of Knox and directed CPS to communicate with him instead.Dane County’s child protective services closed the case after finding no evidence of abuse.“It must be terrible for people who don’t have the same resources we do,” Marshall said.Video clears Madison parents\n",
      "In another case, a Madison mom in 2015 was in the same room as her toddler, and his dad was one room away, when they heard him cry out in pain. He had fallen into the side of the couch and began favoring his left arm. The parents rushed him to West Towne Clinic, a UW Health urgent care clinic, where X-rays revealed a break in the boy’s left arm. The clinic sent the family to UW’s emergency department.\n",
      "There, a radiologist said the break showed signs of healing, prompting emergency medicine Dr. Michael Kim to ask the boy’s parents when their son had broken his arm the first time. Kim noted in his report the parents told him they didn’t know their son had an old injury.Because the child’s injury was unexplained, Kim consulted with the Child Protection Program. He told authorities the case was low risk for abuse. He added that Knox would be unable to determine the exact cause of the injury.After a follow-up appointment with the child protection team six days later, Knox and Palm diagnosed the case as “gravely concerning for nonaccidental trauma.”Palm told Madison Police Detective Matthew Nordquist, if not for the age of the break, the parents would not be under investigation. Delaying medical care is a form of child neglect under Wisconsin law.Nordquist asked Palm if it was possible the boy could have injured his arm without his parents knowing. Palm did not give him a definitive answer, according to his police report.“There’s no way that he could have just hidden it from us for 10 days,” said the boy’s mother, who witnessed nothing out of the ordinary leading up to her son’s injury. She asked not to be named because she also works for the University of Wisconsin.The parents cleared themselves by showing Nordquist footage from the child’s bedroom camera. Nordquist reviewed the videos of the week before the fall, and wrote in his report he saw the boy “gripping toys with his left hand, using it to balance, putting his body weight on it, and using both hands to climb onto furniture as he plays,” and “never observed him favor his arm, look at his arm or show any expression of pain.”\n",
      "The detective closed the case saying he believed the parents sought care as soon as they saw any sign of injury. \n",
      "Mark on skin triggers abuse claimAfter their 5-month-old’s constant drooling irritated and cracked the skin on his chest, his parents sought medical care. But their pediatrician’s colleague, who saw the baby that day, instead focused on a mark on his left arm.\n",
      "The pediatrician referred the family, who lived in Madison at the time, to UW Health’s child protection team for over four hours of extensive testing that included an eye exam and an attempted but failed blood draw. The baby “had bruises all over his arms from all the needle sticks,” his mother recalled.The baby’s mother, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, who knew this mark was from her son’s habit of sucking on his arm, was told that “ ‘Kids won’t do that when they’re six months old.’ ”In medical records, Palm wrote the “case is being diagnosed as gravely concerning for physical abuse,” and that Knox reviewed the case and agreed.\n",
      "A police officer and CPS worker closed their cases after witnessing the baby repeatedly sucking his left arm in the hospital.The parents asked to remain anonymous because of the stigma of child abuse allegations.\n",
      "Dr. Barbara Knox and Physician Assistant Amanda Palm are seen on the cover of the Spring 2018 Physician Assistant Spotlight newsletter. The article features the Child Protection Program at the American Family Children’s Hospital. Palm is quoted as saying, “Knowing that you’re helping is really powerful.” (University of Wisconsin-Madison Physician Assistant Program newsletter)\n",
      "False medical info given to authorities\n",
      "The Shebestas first brought Henry to the UW because their pediatrician sent them there. The doctor treated Henry during an episode of flu-like symptoms that did not resolve and after an MRI found bleeding on the baby’s brain.He warned the parents that UW doctors would question them as a matter of protocol because they had no explanation for the bleeding. He told the Shebestas he would vouch for them.Dr. Bermans Iskandar, who led a team of neurosurgeons caring for Henry, reported finding bilateral “chronic subdural collections,” or bleeding, on both sides of the baby’s brain. Henry would eventually have a successful surgery to alleviate the bleeding.\n",
      "The day before the surgery, the Shebestas were referred to the hospital’s child protection team. During the couple’s initial interviews, a detective and a CPS worker delivered shocking new — and false — information about their son’s condition. \n",
      "Greg Shebesta remembered a detective said Henry had three distinct brain bleeds that occurred on three separate days. Someone, they were told, had intentionally harmed their son, and he was now brain damaged. They suggested the child’s caregiver could be to blame, but the Shebestas insisted the woman — whom they trusted completely — would never harm Henry.“This was the first time we had heard this information, and it devastated both of us,” Katie Shebesta wrote in a letter to hospital officials that the couple did not send out of fear of retaliation.When they returned to Henry’s hospital room, neurosurgeon Iskandar was prepping Henry for a bedside procedure. They asked him if what they just heard was true. \n",
      "Iskandar refuted the statements and went to find Knox. They would later learn Knox had not consulted with the neurologist before she gave authorities incorrect medical information.Confused and wanting answers, the couple requested a conference with Knox on their second night in the hospital. They said after she showed up hours late, Knox explained that Henry’s case was not clear cut because there was no sign of injury.Greg Shebesta asked Knox when the child abuse inquiry would end. The Shebestas both clearly recall Knox’s answer: ??When someone feels guilty enough to confess.\n",
      "Knox’s team ran a battery of tests, which found Henry suffered no broken bones or bleeding behind his eyes. In her report, Knox noted Henry’s Factor XIII blood clotting test result came back “mildly low,” the same blood clotting deficit, Dr. Carol Diamond later said, “very likely” caused Henry’s brain bleeds.\n",
      "Yet, Knox concluded: “The case remains gravely concerning for nonaccidental trauma as the mechanism of injury.”\n",
      "CPS closed the Shebestas’ case, but only after two months of weekly in-home visits, sometimes unannounced, to scrutinize the parents.“People say, ‘What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.’ And we’re not better for it,” Greg Shebesta said.He said the experience left him emotionally drained. “I felt dead inside.”\n",
      "And for a time, he set up a video camera in the family’s living room and turned it on when his wife wasn’t home. Instead of filming precious family memories, Greg Shebesta collected evidence — in case he was ever wrongfully accused of child abuse again.\n",
